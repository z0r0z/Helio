> ERC-6909 Singleton Exchange

LPs are tracked under the [minimal multi-token interface](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6909).

Swapping uses the Uniswap V2 *xyk* curve and some Sushiswap updates to the classic constant product pool.

Such as allowing single-sided LP. Otherwise, Helios also allows for swaps in ERC-1155 and ERC-6909 tokens.
